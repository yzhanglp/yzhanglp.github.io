Hi! I am a senior undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science & Mathematics at HKUST. I'm now a research Intern at Stanford University supervised by [JiaJun Wu](https://jiajunwu.com/) and [Elliott Wu](https://elliottwu.com/). My research interest lies in 3D Computer Vision and generation model, with a specific interest in **leveraging machine learning techniques to comprehend dynamic information in the physical world**. My research goal is to enable machine to understand the dynamic world around us. I also did some research on diffusion-based video editing guided by [Chi-Keung Tang](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/admin/people/faculty/profile/cktang) and [Yu-Wing Tai](https://yuwingtai.github.io/).
